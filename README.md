# RemindAfterDateMonthYear
Learning by repetition

Everytime running the program It will ask the user what have you learn for today and will review later

I want to remember what is important that I learn and want to review it later and remember forever
Therefore I set interval of 1 day, 3 day , 7 day , 14 day, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 3 year, and 10 year
the output file will be like this
if today is 25.03.2019
then 1 day : 26.3.2019
     7 day : 1.4.2019
     1 month : 26.4.2019
     

After coding. I have learned that It is way more complicated than I have thought

- I did not think about the edge case of how many days in the month
- The date when putting the stringstream like 1 -> 01. I did not account that ._.. Probably have to think through the next time.
- I learned that when do the ()? : condition. should put 1 more parenthesis outside of all those to be safe.
- too many variables, like 1day, 3day, 7day, 1month ... -> could put it into the list or vector. Instead of copy and paste it again and again
the next time should think through with the question: How can I do it faster, what test cases that I needed? can I put into vector to make things faster and avoid repetition copy paste
- be careful a little bit with if else statement. mistakenly use else if when should be if, and many cases got neglected!

Possibly redo and optimize the code one day!
